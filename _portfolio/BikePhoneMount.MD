## Introduction and Top-down Modelingp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to regular methods to model components, Fusion 360 offers a facilitated method to design models (or components) ontop one already existing component. So called Top-down modeling, users are able to create new components in relation to eachother without having the need to open a new document to create and adjust dimensions according to related components. For our project specifically, a phone model of choice and the bicycle handle were first imported onto a file then top-down modeling was utilized to model a phone mount, handle to phone link, and handle mount all within one document, all in relation to one another.

## Phone mount components

#### Phone Mount

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the imported phone model (that has been grounded), a separate component was created to utilize the top-down modeling method. First, a rigid base was extruded with plenty of tolerance (~0.2 mm), and then extrude remove was utilized to enable flexibility while decreasing material needed to print such a model.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To account for potential failures, where the phone fails to fit nicely, the top part of the phone mount was designed to allow for flexibility compared to the bottom, and the reasoning to have a bridging component near the bottom was to prevent the phone from falling off the mount too easily when placed onto the bicycle in a vertical orientation.

#### Handle to Phone Link

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting a model ontop of the phone mount, the handle to phone link was easily created via top-down approach for easy attachment using M3 fasteners and a dovetail joint to easily mount and dismount the phone from the handle mount. Simplicity was the main objective for this component.

#### Handle Mount

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last component of the bicycle phone mount is the handle mount. It was designed to allow for a comparatively easy way to secure onto a 25 mm diameter handle using a M5 allen wrench, and in terms of connecting onto the link, a plus sign-shaped extrude removes were utilized to allow for the phone to be in a horizontal and vertical orientation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the bottom was blocked off to prevent the phone from slipping through the handle mount with ease.
