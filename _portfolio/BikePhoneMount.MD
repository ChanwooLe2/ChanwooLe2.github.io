## Introduction and Top-down Modelingp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to regular methods to model components, Fusion 360 offers a facilitated method to design models (or components) ontop one already existing componoent. So called Top-down modeling, users are able to create new components in relation to eachother without having the need to open a new document to create and adjust dimensions according to related components. For our project specifically, a phone model of choice and the bicycle handle were first imported onto a file then top-down modeling was utilized to model a handle mount, phone mount, and a handle to phone link all within one document, all in relation to another.
