## Features

* **Various extrusion rates.** As far as the code goes, any operator may change the rate at which the liquid exits the syringe.
* **Exchangeable syringe sizes** This pump has two components that can hold bold a 10 mL syringe and a 20 mL syringe. The ability to change syringe sizes has critical implications for different purposes: for example, if more liquid is needed, the operator may utilize a 20 mL syringe to better suit their needs.

## Parts required

* **Off-the-shelf parts**
* 2040 aluminum extruson (1)
