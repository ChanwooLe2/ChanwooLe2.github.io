## Introduction and Project Goals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project goals are as follows. We plan to create a robot that is (1) capable of swimming underwater using biomimetic locomotion (undulating motion) and then (2) dock onto the inner surfaces of a pipe to (3) provide information about the fluids flowing through the pipe.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of Fall 2024, I was tasked with starting the project while my partner, a junior undergraduate student, was finishing up his research paper, but I will speak on behalf of the project's current progress as a whole.

## Mechanical Systems:
#### Locomotion Module:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undulating motion is achieved using 6 sets of four-bar linkage combined with a crankshaft (two in total).
