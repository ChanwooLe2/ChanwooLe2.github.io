## Introduction and Generative Design
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generative Design is a CAD modeling method in which an AI creates bodies given the user-defined obstacle and preserves geometries. Simply, obstacle geometries are places where the AI must avoid putting material (i.e. holes for screws) while preserve geometries are those that must be included within the model. Although the whole generating process takes countless hours, often overnight, the generative design feature allows users to end up with different possible outcomes, or geometries, for the same givens, which may provide them with inspiration on how to go about a certain component. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for our project, we were to work with an electric longboard; more specifically, we were tasked to come up with a design for the hanger and motor mount component through the use of generative design. Below are two different components (Nylon 12 and AlSi10Mg) created based on the same given obstacle and preserve geometries.
