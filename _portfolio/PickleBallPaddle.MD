## Motive behind The Frying Pan Pickleball Paddle

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though a frying pan may seemingly have nothing to do with pickleball paddles, it does exceptionally well in serving the same duty. To justify some of the design choices while making the frying pan pickleball paddle, I wanted to make sure that the paddle looked just like a frying pan so that anyone who came across the paddle in action would instantly know that the paddle was, in reality, a filament-fabricated frying pan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more serious note, when considering the round edges, increasing end diameter, and size limitations, I wanted to find the perfect balance between pan surface area (to maximize the area at which the ball hits the pan) while also making the handle long enough for the players to have no trouble using them. A more specific design choice that was made had to do with the printing process. Since the volume of the pan was significantly greater than that of the handle, the pan was printed with less infill (8%) while the handle was printed with more (25%). The pan ended up printing with a center of mass like that of an actual pickleball paddle (slightly below the center of the pan), which created a highly distinguishable filament frying that was optimized for pickleball playing. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last note, the infill pattern of the pan was gyroid, and although that may have not improved the impact resistance of the pan as compared to rectilinear, the pan was able to withstand a whole day, 1 or 2 games.
