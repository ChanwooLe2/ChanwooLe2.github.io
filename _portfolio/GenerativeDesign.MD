title: "Electric Longboard Hanger + Motor Mount"
excerpt: "As a critical component of the DIY electric longboard, the hanger and motor mount was created mostly through use of generative design, and it was created while keeping in mind the various forces that may destroy it. ."

## Introduction and Generative Design
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generative Design is a CAD modeling method in which an AI creates bodies given the user defined obstacle and preserve geometries. Simply, obstacle geometries are places where the AI must avoid putting material into (i.e. holes for screws) while preserve geometries are those that must be included within the model. Although the whole generating process is one that takes countless hours, often over night, the generative design feature allows users to end up with different possible outcomes, or geometries, for the same givens, which mmay provide them with inspiration on how to go about a certain component. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for our project, we were to work with an electric longboard; more specifically, we were tasked to come up with a design for the hanger and motor mount component through use of generative design. Below are two different components (Nylon 12 and AlSi10Mg) created based on the same given obstacle and preserve geometries.
