## Printing with multiple materials?

   Of the several techniques involving multimaterial FFF, the print-in-place is a technique in which within one print, multiple materials may cooperate to achieve a desired feature. This way of printing multiple materials allows for the user to utilize this desired feature right after printing without an assembly since all parts are printed within one print session (note that materials are assigend accordingly). 

## Material selection with multimaterials

  Given that a printer is able to print multiple materials, it is also important to know its applications. One of the common ways to utilize this technology is through use of TPU and PLA.
