## Printing with multiple materials?

   Of the several techniques involving multimaterial FFF, the print-in-place is a technique in which within one print, multiple materials may cooperate to achieve a desired feature. This way of printing multiple materials allows for the user to utilize this desired feature right after printing without an assembly since all parts are printed within one print session (note that materials are assigend accordingly). 

## Material selection with multimaterials

#### TPU and PLA

  Given that a printer is able to print multiple materials, it is also important to know its applications. One of the common ways to utilize this technology is through use of TPU and PLA.

   As displayed in the image, TPU, with its elastic property, acts as a spring component in the aligator clip, and the rigid PLA structure is able to clip certain objects.

#### Soluble/Dissolvable Supports

  When there is an overhang is greater than 45Â°, breakaway supports are usually used to prevent prints from failing, and these breakaway supports tend to get annoying in situations where it may be physically difficult to remove them. Printing multimaterial, however, enables users to print soluble/dissolvable supports. A common combination of material is PLA and PVA or ABS and HIPs.

  The video showcases PVA soluble supports in action, and as can be seen, complex geometries that inhibit the removal of supports may benefit greatly from use of water soluble or dissolvable supports.
